            <h1>About My Learning Website</h1>
            <p>
                This website is designed to teach the bassics and advanced
                conceprs of HTML. Starting With headings amd paragraphs, we
                gradually moce intomore complex topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>HTML lists</strong> are essential for organizing
                content. We have covered
                <em>ordered lists, unordered lists,</em> and
                <em>definition lists</em> to create well-structured information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding <mark>image paths</mark> is crucial. We have
                explored relativepaths for local files and absolute paths for
                external resources. This knowledge is key for web development.

            <h2>Taxt Formating</h2>
            <p>
                HTML provides various tags to format text, like
                <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and
                <sup>superscript</sup>. Use these to make your content engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also explored how to add <del>removed text</del> and
                <ins>inserted text</ins>, giving us flexibility in how we
                present information. Using the
                <span style="color: #f10814">style attribute</span>, we can
                easily change text color and background color.
